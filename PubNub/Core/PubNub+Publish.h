 @brief      Helper method which allow to calculate resulting message before it will be sent to \b PubNub 
             network.
 @note       Size calculation use percent-escaped \c message and all added headers to get full size.
 @discussion Extension to \c -sizeOfMessage:toChannel:compressed:storeInHistory:withCompletion: and allow to 
             specify metadata payload which will should be sent along with message.
 @discussion \b Example:
 
 @code
// Client configuration.
PNConfiguration *configuration = [PNConfiguration configurationWithPublishKey:@"demo" 
                                                                 subscribeKey:@"demo"];
self.client = [PubNub clientWithConfiguration:configuration];
[self.client sizeOfMessage:@{@"Hello":@"world"} toChannel:@"announcement" compressed:NO 
            storeInHistory:NO withMetadata:@{@"to":@"John Doe"} completion:^(NSInteger size) {

    // Actual message size is: size
}];
 @endcode
 
 @param message         Message for which size should be calculated.
 @param channel         Name of the channel to which message should be sent (it is part of request URI).

 @param shouldStore     \c NO in case if message shouldn't be available after it has been sent via history

                        messages.
 @param block           Reference on block which should be sent, when message size calculation will be
