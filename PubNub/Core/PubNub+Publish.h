 Extension to \c -sizeOfMessage:toChannel:compressed:withCompletion: and specify whether message 
 should be stored in history or not.

 \b Example:
 
 @code
 // Client configuration.
 PNConfiguration *configuration = [PNConfiguration configurationWithPublishKey:@"demo" 
                                                                  subscribeKey:@"demo"];
 self.client = [PubNub clientWithConfiguration:configuration];
 [self.client sizeOfMessage:@{@"Hello":@"world"} toChannel:@"announcement" compressed:NO 
             storeInHistory:NO withCompletion:^(NSInteger size) {
 
     // Actual message size is: size
 }];
 @endcode
 
 @param message         Message for which size should be calculated.
 @param channel         Name of the channel to which message should be sent (it is part of request 
                        URI).
 @param compressMessage \c YES in case if message should be compressed before sending to \b PubNub
                        network.
 @param shouldStore     \c NO in case if message shouldn't be available after it has been sent via
                        history storage API methods group.
 @param block           Reference on block which should be sent, when message size calculation will
                        be completed.
