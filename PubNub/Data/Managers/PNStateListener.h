 @brief      Subscriber state listeners manager.
 @discussion Subscriber manager work in pair with state listener manager. Using manager's ability user able to
             add multiple listeners for state events which is triggered on subscriber. Listeners may receive 
             events about new message or presence event on one of remote data objects live feed. Also 
             listeners will receive subscriber state change (connected, disconnected, unexpected disconnect
