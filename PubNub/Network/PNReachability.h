 @brief      \b PubNub network reachability / ping utility.
 @discussion This class used by \b PubNub client to check whether current \b PubNub network state
             allow to send any requests to it or not.
             Mostly this method used after unexpected disconnection (on network failure) to start
             remote service ping process (at least ping once).
